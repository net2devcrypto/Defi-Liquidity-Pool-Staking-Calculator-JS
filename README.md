//DeFI Pool 1 ETH/N2DR Values
```shell
const pool1TotalStaked = 250000
const pool1UserStake = 1250
const pool1Allocation = 5000
```
//DeFI Pool 2 MATIC/N2DR Values
```shell
const pool2TotalStaked = 250000
const pool2UserStake = 850
const pool2Allocation = 2500
```
//DeFI Pool 3 BNB/N2DR Values
```shell
const pool3TotalStaked = 10000000
const pool3UserStake = 5400
const pool3Allocation = 2500
```

if you want to calculate rewards in time, basically is substracting endblock minus start block or change the multiplier value in milliseconds
example 1 minute
```shell
let multiplier = 60000
```

don't forget to save everytime you make changes before running!!
